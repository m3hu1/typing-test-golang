# Typing Test

A simple web application built with Go (Golang). 

## Overview

I was trying to learn Golang, so I made this typing test application using Golang instead of JavaScript for the backend. Users can type words that are randomized from `words.txt`, and the app calculates their typing accuracy and words per minute (WPM).

## Features

- Randomized words for each session
- Accuracy and WPM calculation
- Uses Go instead of JS

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Go (Golang)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/m3hu1/typing-test-golang.git
2. Navigate into the cloned repo:
   ```bash
   cd typing-test-golang
2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
3. Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.
4. Start typing in the input field and press the `enter` or `return` key to see the results.
